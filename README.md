# Hand-Gestured-Robot
Robots which helps in movements with only by the Hand Movement.This paper portrays the plan and execution of a robot that moves by  hand motions. Accordingly, it expels the issue of utilizing joysticks or switches. The  robot's speed is additionally controlled during its development by the hand. An  accelerometer has been utilized that changes over various hand motions into information  signals. The robot has two segments: the transmitting end and the receiving end. The  transmitting end transmits the motion signals and the receiving end gets them. The  accelerometer fills in as the sensor as it detects the various motions made by the hand and  changes over them into simple signs which are additionally prepared and transmitted to  the receiving end.
